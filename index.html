            There's a shop down the street
            Where they sell plastic rings
            For a quarter a piece, I swear it
            Yeah, I know that it's cheap
            Not like gold in your dreams
            But I hope that you'll still wear it

            Yeah, the ink may stain my skin
            And my jeans may all be ripped
            I'm not perfect, but I swear
            I'm perfect for you

            And there's no guarantee
            That this will be easy
            It's not a miracle you need, believe me
            Yeah, I'm no angel, I'm just me
            But I will love you endlessly
            Wings aren't what you need, you need me

            There's a house on the hill
            With a view of the town
            And I know how you adore it
            So I'll work everyday
            Through the sun, and the rain
            Until I can afford it

            Yeah, your friends may think I'm crazy
            Cause they can only see
            I'm not perfect, but I swear, I'm perfect for you

            There's a shop down the street
            Where they sell plastic rings
            For a quarter a piece, I swear it
            Yeah, I know that it's cheap
            Not like gold in your dreams
            But I hope that you'll still wear it
